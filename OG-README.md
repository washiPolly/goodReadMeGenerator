Node and ES6 Homework Assignment

Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:
node index.js
The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.
The README will be populated with the following:

At least one badge
Project title
Description
Table of Contents
Installation
Usage
License
Contributing
Tests
Questions

User GitHub profile picture
User GitHub email
